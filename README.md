# EazyML-Hackathon-Submission
My Submission For EazyML Hackathon
To run my program, the user first needs to decide on which county they would like to check for wildfire risk. Once they have a county in mind they need to input the ID of this county where the "6" is located in the 'prediction.csv' file. After doing that, they should be able to run the code. In about a minute, the program will have tested the safety of moving to that location.
